# Feather

### Description
Feather is a development library for [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) plugins.
Its primary intention is to reduce boilerplate code and ship with commonly used and sought after utility methods, while still maintaining a lightweight footprint.
